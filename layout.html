        <p><b>There are many different kinds of pandas, but the most
            common panda is the giant panda. The species is native to
            South Central China, where it consumes bamboo shoots and
            leaves for nutrition. Giant pandas in the wild also
            occasionally eat different grasses, wild tubers or even 
            smaller animals.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Giant pandas are characterized by its black-and-white coat
            and rotund body where they have black spots on the ears, 
             eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. Their coat
             is speculated to bring them protection in their heavily
             shaded environment, as most predators are colorblind. 
             They have the body shape of a typical bear. </b>
